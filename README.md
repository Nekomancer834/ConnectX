# README

* Connect X is a game for 2-6 people where they try to get 4 of their pieces in a row with the added difficulty of features from other games. At the beginning, the GO feature will add more difficulty and complexity as the player count rises. If a player’s piece is surrounded by 4 other player’s pieces and one is a GO piece, the center piece is converted to the surrounding color. The product will also support later expansions featuring new pieces to spice up the gameplay further.
